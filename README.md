# Problem statement

Implement an API to control a rover on the surface of Mars.

## Model

The rover has a position given by coordinates `x` and `y`, and an orientation: `north`, `west`, `south` or `east`.

## Required features

1. Move
2. Turn
3. Take aerial photos with a drone

### TDD driven by ZOMBIES
Z - zero (exists)
O - one
M - many

# Rules

1. Use Go
2. Use TDD
3. Look up questions in documentation, stackoverflow, etc.

## TDD (Test-driven development) cycle

1. Write a test that fails
2. Write only enough code for it to pass
3. If possible improve code quality (refactoring)
